OWASP Top 10
============

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a list of the 10 most important web vulnerabilities. The current version (2017) is under revision, but this document is based on the Release Candidate. This is a high-level framework for web vulnerabilities, though OWASP also has a lot of practical information.

This is my summary (for myself), as well as links to practical examples in both CTFs and the real world. In accordance with my general spoilers policy, I will hide references to specific problems under summary boxes, and will not provide details on how to solve a problem.
