# Missing Topics
This is a (ongoing) list of things I want to put in this repo. 

## Write-Ups
These should be clearly written examples of cybersecurity topics. Any examples taken from CTFs should not mention the puzzle it came from and should be as general as possilbe to avoid spoilers. 

- [ ] How .zip files work + how to use hexedit to fix them
- [ ] Basic command line + perl usage
- [ ] Program execution layout (the stack)
- [ ] Unicode Conversion
- [ ] Off by One (Boundry Checking)
- [ ] Buffer Overflow (break into sub-pages?)
- [ ] Format String

## Programs
These should be simple command-line utilities for linux. Some of these tools will duplicate other's work, but the practice will be fun.

- [ ] Filetype reader (Just checks to see if it has a known file header)
- [ ] .zip header verifier (Compares the file headers in the central directory with the local file headers for discrepancies)
